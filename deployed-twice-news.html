<p>I just got back from the first Internet-in-a-Box deployment at a school
for kids in a women's shelter.  They were thrilled to have the
Internet-in-a-Box and a dozen One Laptop Per Child laptops.</p>
<p>Everything worked out of the box.  I set them up with a GoFlex Home
wired device and a WRT54G access point.  The only hiccup is that the
OLPC laptops (all slow first model units from circa 2006) struggled a
bit playing the Khan Academy videos.</p>
<p>They have promised to give both us and the OLPC group a lot of regular
feedback.</p>
<p>Our second deployment is now on its way to Sierra Leone.  I dropped it
in the mail yesterday, and our local contact will be flying with it to
Sierra Leone on Wednesday.  He administers IT for half a dozen schools
there.</p>
<p>Next week I am flying to Toronto for a hackathon with the OLPC &quot;School
Server&quot; team to find ways to integrate Internet-in-a-Box with their
efforts.  They administer over 10,000 school servers world wide and are
working on a new version.</p>
<p>I've been a bit introverted and haven't been issuing a lot of group
tasks.  There has been a lot going on and I've been keeping my head down
and fallen back to my habit of just getting all these things done myself.</p>
<p>But, I DO need help on IIAB.  After Toronto next week I simply cannot
afford to continue to spend this much time (and money) on it.</p>
