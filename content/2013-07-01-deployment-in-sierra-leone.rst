Successful deployment in Sierra Leone
#####################################

Finally heard back from the school in Sierra Leone!  Looks like they
are up and running well with Internet-in-a-Box.  Sent us some nice
pictures of the students using it to learn about osmosis.

Our contact wants more IIAB devices for the other schools he works
with there.

So we have two successful deployments now.  The Pakistan deployment
got delayed because of exceptional shipping problems, but should
happen later this summer.
