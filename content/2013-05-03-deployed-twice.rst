I just got back from the first Internet-in-a-Box deployment at a school 
for kids in a women's shelter.  They were thrilled to have the 
Internet-in-a-Box and a dozen One Laptop Per Child laptops.

Everything worked out of the box.  I set them up with a GoFlex Home 
wired device and a WRT54G access point.  The only hiccup is that the 
OLPC laptops (all slow first model units from circa 2006) struggled a 
bit playing the Khan Academy videos.

They have promised to give both us and the OLPC group a lot of regular 
feedback.

Our second deployment is now on its way to Sierra Leone.  I dropped it 
in the mail yesterday, and our local contact will be flying with it to 
Sierra Leone on Wednesday.  He administers IT for half a dozen schools 
there.

Next week I am flying to Toronto for a hackathon with the OLPC "School 
Server" team to find ways to integrate Internet-in-a-Box with their 
efforts.  They administer over 10,000 school servers world wide and are 
working on a new version.

I've been a bit introverted and haven't been issuing a lot of group 
tasks.  There has been a lot going on and I've been keeping my head down 
and fallen back to my habit of just getting all these things done myself.

But, I DO need help on IIAB.  After Toronto next week I simply cannot 
afford to continue to spend this much time (and money) on it.
