Four new Internet-in-a-Box devices are now on their way to school
deployments in Sierra Leone (2), Malawi, and Kiribati!

These join our prior deployments in Haiti (2), Sierra Leone, Pakistan,
and Los Angeles.

In addition, the Unleashed Kids project is preparing to ship hard drives
containing Internet-in-a-Box as a bonus with some of their 400 One
Laptop Per Child XO-4 laptops now for sale.
