<p>I've been working with a really great group of half a dozen OLPC
volunteers up here in a big farmhouse in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>This group is developing a server configuration called School Server
XS-CE.  Their server provides DHCP, web filtering, chat, NAT firewall,
backup, and other services for schools using the OLPC XO laptops.  Their
baseline hardware is to install on a spare OLPC XO Laptop itself with a
USB Ethernet dongle for upstream.</p>
<p>They are very keen to integrate Internet-in-a-Box.</p>
<p>I have IIAB running on an XO Laptop with data on a USB hard drive, and a
written procedure for installing it on the School Server.</p>
<p>However, IIAB is not yet ready to be packaged and deployed in this way,
on the same machine as the School Server.  It is easier for us to deploy
as a stand-alone network appliance which the School Server discovers on
the network and links to until we are more mature.  The OLPC guys have
written a CGI script which detects if an IIAB is on the LAN and provides
a link to it.</p>
<p>The new version of School Server is set to be deployed in the next few
months.  There are 10,000 older School Servers already deployed in the
world serving maybe a million kids, so this is a large market for us.</p>
<p>We are generating a lot of interest.</p>
